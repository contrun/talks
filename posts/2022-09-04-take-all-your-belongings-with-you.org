# 标题：Take All Your Belongings with You: A Touch of Personal Computing

# 介绍：我将会和大家分享一点微小的 self-hosting （自托管）（或者更广泛地个人计算，personal computing）经验。我会先宽泛地介绍一下 personal computing，然后展示一下个人计算有什么个人的，为什么使用云端服务（别人的电脑）无法满足我的个人需求，我搭建了哪些服务来满足我高度定制化的需求。最后我会根据大家的意见选择某些主题（包括远程开发、数据备份、安全、数据同步等）谈谈我的经验。分享的材料可见于 https://self/ 。

# 另：作为预热，大家可以看看 Stephen Wolfram 关于他的个人计算的基础设施的文章 https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2019/02/seeking-the-productive-life-some-details-of-my-personal-infrastructure/ ，也可以点击 https://redacted/ 查看我现在搭建的一些 web 服务（趁现在网站还没挂）。

* Introduction

+ What is self hosting?
+ Why I choose to be a self-hoster?
+ Is it viable to self host everything?
+ Show something that is made possible with self hosting.
+ A few selected topics in self-hosting, e.g. remote development, data backup, network security.

* Why
** I want my data back

[[../pictures/i-want-my-money-back.jpg]]

It is an intellectual humiliation to not be able to take my things back. [[https://ruben.verborgh.org/facebook/][Getting my personal data out of Facebook | Ruben Verborgh]].
Doubly so when they exploit your data, and then take your data as hostage to let they continue their exploiting.

A real world metaphor [[https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-62514631][Lebanon man hailed hero for holding Beirut bank hostage over savings - BBC News]]

** Freedom as an utility
Just having the possibility is exulting.

*** The freedom to run, copy, distribute, study, change and improve the software
Kind of raison d'etre.

[[../pictures/perfect-meme.jpg]]

I read a lot of articles with [[https://getpocket.com/][Pocket]]. The search function of Pocket works poorly. I frequently find myself unable to recall some articles I saved on pocket.
I am pretty excited about Mozilla's acquisition of pocket,
I imagine it would be easier for me to export my data, and auto-label the articles I read on pocket.
My wish is like waiting for Godot, it bears no fruits, cf [[https://github.com/Pocket/extension-save-to-pocket/issues/75][Open source Pocket server-side code]].
I want the potential of improving something I use everyday.

* Tenets

[[../pictures/commandments.jpg]]

** Offline first
*** What's it?
[[https://offlinefirst.org/][Offline First]]
*** Why is it important?
High avaibility in the presense of network partition, But what about inconsitence, not critical in the case of personal computing.
Also may use all the standard methods to solve inconsistency.

** Bring your own client
*** What's it?
[[https://www.geoffreylitt.com/2021/03/05/bring-your-own-client.html][Bring Your Own Client]]
*** Why is it important?
Email clients as an example. Read and write email with [[https://www.djcbsoftware.nl/code/mu/mu4e/][mu4e]] in emacs!

** Interoperability
*** What's it?
[[https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2020/07/legislative-path-interoperable-internet][A Legislative Path to an Interoperable Internet]]
*** Why is it important?
Not only client Interoperable with the server. Also data portability, back-end interoperability, and delegability.
Take [[https://joinbookwyrm.com/][BookWyrm]] as an example.

** Weak centralization
*** What's it?
Another Penrose triangle
*** Why is it important?
Take [[https://github.com/ellie/atuin][atuin]] as an example.

Mount remote storage, and expose them in a standarized interface.

* Selected topics
** Remote access
*** connectivity
**** DDNS + router port mapping
  Need to dial up with your router, not the fiber optic modem.
  You may do all the DDNS port mapping work in the router if your router is flexible enough.
  Or you may run [[https://github.com/miniupnp/miniupnp][miniupnp]] in your server.

**** remote port mapping
  [[https://www.harding.motd.ca/autossh/][autossh]] (my favorite), [[https://ngrok.com/][ngrok]], [[https://github.com/fatedier/frp][frp]], [[https://github.com/ehang-io/nps][nps]].
  Not enough if you have a few hosts to manage.

**** [[https://www.torproject.org/][TOR]]
  With a relay network, but it not so censorship-resistant.

**** Static VPN solutions
  Wireguard is not dynamic enough. O(n) cost for a new host. Manually IPAM (ip addresses management). Not able to penetrate double-NAT.

**** Magic overlay networks
  All computer science problems can be solved by adding a new layer of indirection.
  There are many solutions, e.g. [[https://github.com/zerotier/ZeroTierOne][zerotier]], [[https://github.com/tailscale/tailscale][tailscale]], [[https://github.com/gravitl/netmaker][netmaker]], [[https://github.com/tonarino/innernet][innernet]], [[https://github.com/slackhq/nebula][nebula]], [[https://github.com/juanfont/headscale][headscale]], [[https://github.com/netbirdio/netbird][netbird]], [[https://github.com/firezone/firezone][firezone]].
  + Single sign-on
  + Auto hole punching
  + Fallback to relay host when necessary
  + Whole network stack available

*** node discovery
**** MDNS/LLMNR
  Ever wonder how timemachine server on your LAN is discovered, or why you can just ping hostname in Windows?
  Free lunch if your overlay network supports multicast.
**** Coredns
  More magic.
  + [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Split-horizon_DNS][Split-horizon DNS]], i.e. resolving ~hostname.example.com~ to ~hostname.local~ in LAN, or else resolving it to edge proxies.
  + Wildcard DNS record, i.e. cnaming ~*.hostname.example.com~ to ~hostanme.example.com~

*** exposing http services
Dynamic and self organizing.
**** SSL termination
**** Routing rules

** Synchronization
*** [[https://syncthing.net/][Syncthing]]
Syncing without a 7x24 hour listening server
*** [[https://github.com/rclone/rclone][rclone]] bisync
+ Rich back end api support, almost supports every backend storage under the sun
+ Highly modular architecte, may optionaly chunk, encrypt another repo
*** [[https://cryptomator.org/][cryptomator]]
+ Mounting common storage backends
+ Encryption at rest
+ Easy to use
*** [[https://github.com/rclone/rclone][rclone]]/[[https://github.com/drakkan/sftpgo][sftpgo]]
+ Serving the synced files while syncing is not set up on a temporary device
+ With web interface
+ Supporting access with webdav/sftp etc

** Backup
*** Caveats
The [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time-of-check_to_time-of-use][Time-of-check to time-of-use]] problem in the case of data backup.
An almost harmless example is that the backup software first reads the ~dirent~ to get a list of all files,
and then it tries to read the file content, now it founds out the file is no longer there. So backing up this file failed.
A more pernicious example is that the backup software backs up two inconsistent part of a file, thus results in file corruption.
If you want to be absolutely sure about the integerity of the file, you can either let the underlying software so its back up job,
or create a file system level snapshot.

*** File system backup
+ snapshotting, e.g. [[https://github.com/zfsonlinux/zfs-auto-snapshot][zfsonlinux/zfs-auto-snapshot]]
+ backup, e.g. [[https://github.com/jimsalterjrs/sanoid/][jimsalterjrs/sanoid]]

*** File system agnostic backup
Two styles of backing up
+ Create an archive and forget it. When the back up lags behind current state too much. Create a new backup and overwrite existing one.
+ Continuous, incremental back up some directory. Everything the back job runs, the backup software create a snapshot, tries to deduplicate file contents.

**** tar
#+begin_src shell
  tar -C "$HOME" --zstd -cpf - --one-file-system --exclude-vcs-ignores --exclude-backups --exclude-caches-all --exclude="$encrypted_backup_file" "$HOME" | gpg --yes --pinentry-mode loopback --symmetric --cipher-algo aes256 -o "$encrypted_backup_file"
#+end_src

**** rclone
#+begin_src shell
  rclone sync ~/Sync/ backup-primary-encrypted:/sync/
  cat ~/.config/rclone/rclone.conf
  [backup-primary-encrypted]
  type = crypt
  remote = backup-primary:encrypted
  password = passwordheree
#+end_src

**** [[https://github.com/restic/restic/][restic]]
+ With all the rclone backends
+ Encryption, deduplication, incremental backup
+ No compression
**** [[https://github.com/borgbackup/borg/][borgbackup]]
+ Can only back up to host with ssh access, or back up locally
+ Encryption, deduplication, incremental backup
+ Compression
