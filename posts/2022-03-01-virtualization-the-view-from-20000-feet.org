* THE CRUX: HOW TO VIRTUALIZE THE MACHINE UNDERNEATH THE OS?
The virtual machine monitor must transparently virtualize the machine underneath the OS; what are the techniques required to do so?

* Popek and Goldberg virtualization requirements
** Sensentive Instructions
*** Control-sensitive
Update system state, e.g. change GDTR, direct access to PM, VMXON.
*** Behavior-senstive
Semeantics depends on the system state, e.g. visibility to IDT.

** Popek and Goldberg First theorem
For any conventional third-generation computer, a virtual
machine monitor may be constructed if the set of sensitive instructions for
that computer is a subset of the set of privileged instructions.

** Trap and Emulate

** VMCS
*** What's it?
A data structuwre which control the behavior of processor in VMX non-root mode and control VMX transitions.
